43234,"Focus of hypodensity in the left parietal lobe.  This likely represents a slight asymmetry in the age expected immaturity the white matter, less likely could represent focal edema.  In the absence of focal neurologic findings, is of doubtful significance",
43276,"A tiny focal peripheral hyperdensity in the left frontal temporal region, this could be artifactual but a tiny extraaxial hematoma cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation and follow up study is suggested. No other intracranial abnormality. No fracture or malalignment in the visualized cervical spine.",
43300,Temporal sphenodial fracture of the right. No intracranial bleed,Incomplete opacification of the sphenoid sinus is evident. The adenoids are prominent.
43302,1.  Displaced fracture in the left occipital bone.  2.  Hemorrhagic contusion in the right frontal lobe.  3.  Minimal amount of subdural hemorrhage along with the anterior falx.  4.  ...possibility of a non-displaced fracture in the clivus.,
43303,"1. Focal 5mm hemorrhagic contusion of the left parietal high convexity, and layering subdural bleed on the right tentorium cerebelli.  2. Findings suggestive of elevated intracranial pressure  3. Mildly displaced oblique fracture of the left occipital condyle.",
43336,"Small area of increased attenuation in the right parieto-occipital lobes which is probably an artifact, but a small subarachnoid hemorrhage cannot be excluded.  Close follow-up and, if necessary, MRI of the brain is recommended for further evaluation.  Right parietal soft tissue swelling.",
43360,Left parietal fracture. Left cerebellar small focus of white matter hemorrhage. No abnormalities noted from the skull base to C2-3.,some prominence of the ventricular system
43366,"The patient has a left skull base fracture with traumatic diastasis of the left lambdoid suture.  There is extra axial air, possibly within the left transverse/sigmoid sinus.  The fracture complex appears to extend into the left mastoid process since several mastoid air cells and middle ear cavity are partially opacified.  There is no evidence of traumatic brain injury.",opacified mastoid air cells
