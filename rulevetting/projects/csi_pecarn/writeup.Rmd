# Introduction

The advent of computed tomography (CT) scans has given emergency department (ED) doctors a powerful tool for non-invasive medical imaging. CT scans use repeated X-rays to construct cross-sectional images of a patient's body, which provides more information that traditional lateral and other X-rays. Because of their improved diagnostic power, CT scans have become a popular and often standard tool in identifying injuries in adults. The justification for using CT scans in children is an active area of research because the procedure delivers over 30 times more ionizing radiation to a patient than traditional X-rays (@leonard2011factors). Children are more sensitive to the effects of ionizing radiation because their cells divide more frequently than adults', and it is estimated one CT scan leads a $x \%$ change in the rate of fatal cancers. These statistics are reported in an average case and can vary with the age of the CT scanner, its calibration for pediatric patients, and the training of the operator in pediatric care (insert citation).

In this report, we stress test current clinical decision rules for when pediatric patients with cervical spine injuries should receive a CT scan. Cervical spine injuries CT scans are commonly
