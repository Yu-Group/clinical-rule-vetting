# overview
- for setting up, best practice is first to e-mail clinicians, then students, then point everyone to a spreadsheet and ask students to reach out to clinicians


# email 1 (to clinicans)

Thanks X and Y for organizing and kicking us off.

Thanks X, X, and X for agreeing to help us with your valuable expertise! Here are some logistics/a timeline for what we have planned.

Each of you will be connected with a group of 3-4 students to help validate/improve a clinical CDR from a PECARN study. Outside of meetings, we hope your time-commitment will be low. If you are not familiar with your dataset/study, you might read it to get a refresher of the context it was collected in - details for what to prepare / expect from meetings are available here.

Timeline - Note: at all times students should take the initiative to schedule meetings with you and  accommodate your schedule
Nov 10 week - email connecting you with your group/dataset, scheduling followup meetings
Nov 15 week - 1st meeting with group to discuss data
Nov 22 week - asynchronous discussion over google sheets with group
Nov 29 week - 2nd meeting with group to discuss results + some asynchronous discussion
If you at any point are having issues with scheduling or time-commitment please do let us know and we will work to ensure you and the students are supported!

Best,
Chandan
